# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

To build and run this project using Docker, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

### Building the Docker Image

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Build the Docker image using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-react-app .

### Running the Docker Container
1. After the image is built, you can run a container using the following command:

    docker run -p 4000:80 my-react-app
2. Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser to view the app.


### Dockerfile Explanation
The Dockerfile is divided into two stages:

1. - Node.js
    - Base Image: node:20-alpine
    - Working Directory: /app
    - Copy and Install Dependencies: The package*.json and package-lock.json files are copied to the working directory, and npm install is run to install dependencies.
    - Copy Project Files and Build: All project files are copied to the working directory, and npm run build is executed to build the app.
2. - Nginx
    - Base Image: nginx:1.19.0
    - Working Directory: /usr/share/nginx/html
    - Remove Default Files: The default files in the Nginx HTML directory are removed.
    - Copy Build Files: The build files from the previous step are copied to the Nginx HTML directory.
    - Run Nginx: The Nginx server is started with daemon off; to keep it running in the foreground.
